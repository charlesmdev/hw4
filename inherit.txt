We use Python inheritance for the following reasons: Code reusibility and polymorphism. 
Inheritance is useful for programmers to reuse common code from base classes. Common 
code including methods and attributes. This avoid the use of rewriting repetitive code 
and promotes organized and efficient codebases. The second use, polymorphism, which allows
objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. This also 
ties in with promoting organization through abstract classes and other ways too.
